        "# Solution\n",
        "We are going to solve this by bit computation. I will explain the algorithm: First we are going to check which string is longer. Depening on which string is shorter, I add `'0'`'s infront of the string which is shorter. I add the amount which will make the 2 strings equal in length. Why do this? Because I'll be looping through these string. I want to loop over both strings and the loop will go from `max(len(a),len(b))-1` to `0`. In every iteration I'll be summing up 2 numbers. Each number is an element of either `a` or `b`. Now, since binary addition is not the same as normal addition, I create a function which will help me  with this. Let me first explain how binary addition works: If we have `0` and `1`, then the sum is `1`. If we have `1+1` then the sum is `10`. In order to encorporate this remainder, I need this function called `binary`. This function will take in as arguments `n1`, `n2`, `n3`. `n1` and `n2` are the numbers of the strings. `n3` is the remainder from the last addition. So in each loop I calculate 2 things - the sum of the current 2 numbers and the remainder. Note that if we are adding `1+1+n3` where `n3=1`, then the sum is `1` and the remainder is `1`. At each iteration I concatenate the sum to `sum`. At the end, I check if I have a remainder and add `1` to `sum` if needed. After that I return the reverse of `sum`.\n",
