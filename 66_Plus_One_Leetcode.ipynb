        "In this solution we will do 2 loops. In the first loop, we will get the integer from the list. We will do that by summing the numbers multiplied by their respective powers of 10. So for example if we have the following list: `[4,3,2,1]`, we get the number with the following sum: `4*1000 + 3*100 + 2*10 + 1*1 = 4321`. Now we just increment the sum and extract the numbers. We do that in a loop. In an iteration, we get the last digit by getting modulo of 10, then for the next iteration we prepare the number by getting rid of that last number by just dividing by 10 and converting the `flloat` into an `int`. Also note that we are using `//` instead of `/` as the latter messes up the conversion. \n",
