The way I'm going to reverse the second half of the integer is by taking the modulo $10$ of the integer. Then since I'm going to get the last integer$^1$ by doing that, I'm going to remove it from the original number by just dividing the number by $10$ without remainer (converting to integer.. we can do this since if the integer is not divisible by 10, the last number of the integer will be converted to decimal points and we will be able to remove by convering our output to the integer). Now, we get the reversed integer by taking the reversed integer and multiplying it by $10$. This will enable us to add the integer that we got from the modulo. Lastly, we stop iterating once out reversed integer becomes larger than the original (modified) integer, since this will mean that it has more numbers and this means it can't qualify anymore for being equal to the first half of the integer.\n",
