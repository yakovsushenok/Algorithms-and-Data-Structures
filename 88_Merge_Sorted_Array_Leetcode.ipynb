        "# Easy-level Solution\n",
        "The easy level solution is to create a copy of the `nums1` first m elements, `nums1c`, and then for each index of `nums1` to pick the smaller element of the 2 arrays - `nums1c` and `nums2`. This is a 3 pointer technique. We will have `i` to iterate over `nums1c`, then `j` to iterate over `nums2` and `k` for `nums1`. At each `k`, we compare whether `nums1c[i] < nums2[j]` or not. If it's true, then we set `nums1[k]` to be equal to `nums1c[i]` and we increment both `i` and `k` by `1`. If the condition is not true, we do the same but for `j`. Note that we do this only until `k` is equal to the length of `nums1` or until we get `i` to equal `m` or `j` to equal `i`. If `i` is equal to `m`, then we know that we have no more elements to take from `nums1c`, so we iterate over the left over elements from `nums2`. Same for `j=n`. \n",

        "This is a medium-level solution because it doesn't use any additional space (i.e. it's space complexity is $O(1)$ - constant. I'll explain the algorithm - it's a 3 pointer technique like the previous one, however this time we're going to start from the end with `k` going from `m + n - 1` to `0` and the indices `i` and `j` from `m` and `n` to `0` respectively. At each iteration, we compare which is the bigger number from `nums1[i]` and `nums2[j]` and set it to `nums1[k]`. If `nums1[i] > nums2[j]` then we subtract `1` from both `i` and `k`. We do the same for `j` if `nums1[i] =< nums2[j]`. Notice that we put an additional condition in the `nums1[i] > nums2[j]` condition, that is `if i >= 0`. This way if `i` is smaller than `0` and `j` is still larger than `-1`, this means that we haven't appended all of the elements of `j` to `nums1`. We also put an additional condition to the while loop - `if j > 0`. We break the while loop if `j` is smaller than `0`. Think about it, if we iterated through all of the elements from `nums2`, this means that all of the elements from `nums1` are smaller, and those elements are already in order in `nums1`.\n",
